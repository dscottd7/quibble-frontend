# quibble-frontend
Frontend application for Quibble

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based application designed to compare products from different websites. It accepts two URLs and user preferences for comparison factors and passes them to the backend service.  The quibble backend attempts to scrape product information from those web pages (using Selenium), and then prompts OpenAI to generate a detailed comparison between the products based on factors provided by the user, which it returns to this frontend app for display back to the user.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Install the necessary dependencies:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- the backend service URL will default to `ws://localhost:8000/ws/compare/structured` (for local testing) unless a different URL is specified by setting `REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_URL_STRUCTURED=<target_backend_url>` in a `.env` file in your working directory.
- **NOTE**: if building a docker image for local testing or deployment and overriding the default backend service URL per the instruction above, be sure that your are NOT ".dockerignore"-ing your `.env` file (React doesn't have direct access to runtime environment variables after build time).

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
